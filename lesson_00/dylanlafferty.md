# Dylan Lafferty's About Me

---

## Personality

My name is Dylan Lafferty, I am 21 years old and am working towards becoming a Software Engineer.

## Daily Requirements

- I need a full nights rest or else I'll be cranky. I am by no means happy to be awake when it comes to first opening my eyes.
- I need at least 1 Celcius to be locked and loaded.
